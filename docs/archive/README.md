## Notes

### Should I Use These Documents?

**For Historical Reference:** Yes, if you need to understand:
- How a feature was originally implemented
- What issues were encountered during development
- The evolution of the authentication system
- Past deployment configurations

**For Current Development:** No, these documents are outdated. Use:
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for current development guidance
- [docs/README.md](../README.md) for current documentation index
- Active docs in the main docs/ directory

### Can I Delete These?

These documents are preserved for:
1. Understanding the evolution of the codebase
2. Reference during troubleshooting similar issues
3. Learning from past implementation decisions
4. Audit trail for major changes

If disk space becomes a concern, these can be safely removed as the current codebase and documentation contain all necessary information.
