## Current Deployment Status

### ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

#### 1. Git Security Cleanup (2025-10-13)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Removed `.env` file from git history using `git-filter-repo`
  - Updated git remote URL (removed embedded PAT for security)
  - Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub
  - All secret scanning errors resolved
- **Verification:** GitHub push succeeded without security blocks
- **Commit:** `661f812` - "Add explicit build command to Railway configuration"

#### 2. Backend Configuration
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Files Updated:**
  - `railway.toml` - Added `NIXPACKS_BUILD_COMMAND = "npm run build"`
  - `backend/Procfile` - Created with `web: node dist/index.js`
  - `backend/package.json` - Verified scripts (build: tsc, start: node dist/index.js)
- **Purpose:** Ensure Railway runs Node.js Express app instead of Caddy static server

#### 3. Railway Project Setup
- **Status:** ✅ VERIFIED
- **Services:**
  - `imagine-this-printed` (frontend) → `imaginethisprinted.com`
  - `backend` (API) → `api.imaginethisprinted.com`
- **Domain Routing:** Correct (verified via Railway CLI)

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS TASKS

### 1. Backend API Deployment - REQUIRES MANUAL INTERVENTION
- **Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED - Requires Railway Dashboard Configuration
- **Issue:** TypeScript not compiling during Railway build
- **Error:** `Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/index.js'`
- **Root Cause:** Railway/Nixpacks not running `npm run build` automatically
- **Attempts Made:**
  1. ✅ Added Procfile with release phase
  2. ✅ Added chained build command in startCommand
  3. ❌ Both approaches failed - build never executes

- **SOLUTION REQUIRED:** Manual configuration in Railway Dashboard

  **User must do this in Railway Dashboard:**
  1. Go to: Railway.app → Imagine-This-Printed Project → backend service
  2. Navigate to: Settings → Deploy
  3. Add Custom Build Command: `npm run build`
  4. Add Custom Start Command: `node dist/index.js`
  5. Save changes and redeploy

- **Expected Outcome:** `/api/health` returns JSON `{"ok": true}` instead of HTML

## ❌ PENDING TASKS

### 1. API Security Keys Regeneration
- **Status:** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Reason:** Following keys were exposed in git history before cleanup:
  - Sendinblue API Key
  - OpenAI API Key
  - Shippo Live API Token
  - Replicate API Token
  - Stripe API Key
  - +2 more secrets
- **Action Required:** Regenerate all API keys in respective service dashboards
- **Timeline:** Before production launch

### 2. Environment Variables Verification
- **Status:** ⏳ PENDING
- **Check:** Verify all required env vars are set in Railway dashboard
- **Services to Check:**
  - Backend service environment variables
  - Frontend service environment variables
- **Required Variables:**
  - DATABASE_URL (Supabase)
  - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
  - STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
  - OPENAI_API_KEY (if using)
  - Other API keys as needed

### 3. Supabase Authentication Flow
- **Status:** ⏳ UNTESTED
- **Dependencies:** Requires working API endpoint
- **Test Plan:**
  - User registration flow
  - User login flow
  - Password reset flow
  - Session management
- **Location:** See `SUPABASE_LOGIN_FIX.md` for context

### 4. Production Launch Checklist
- **Status:** 📋 DOCUMENTED
- **File:** `PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Review Required:** Check all items before launch

## 🔍 Known Issues

### Issue #1: TypeScript Build Not Running on Railway
- **Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL - BLOCKS ALL API FUNCTIONALITY
- **Impact:** Backend crashes on start, API returns 502 Bad Gateway
- **Error Message:** `Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/index.js'`
- **Root Cause:** Railway/Nixpacks not executing build step before start
- **Attempts Made (All Failed):**
  - Procfile with `release: npm run build`
  - railway.toml with `startCommand = "npm run build && node dist/index.js"`
  - railway.toml with `buildCommand = "npm run build"` (invalid option)
- **Fix Status:** 🔴 REQUIRES MANUAL DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION
- **Solution:** User must add Custom Build Command in Railway Dashboard (see "IN PROGRESS TASKS" section)
- **Commits:** `3e6c03a`, `dc2c3ea`, `90910dd`

### Issue #2: Secrets Exposed in Git History (RESOLVED)
- **Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM (resolved but requires follow-up)
- **Status:** ✅ Git history cleaned
- **Follow-up Required:** Rotate all exposed API keys
- **Timeline:** Before production use

## 🎯 Next Steps for Agents

### Immediate Actions (Agent: MetaDev) - COMPLETE
1. ✅ Create `backend/Procfile`
2. ✅ Update `railway.toml` with deploy config (multiple attempts)
3. ✅ Commit changes to git (commits: 3e6c03a, dc2c3ea, 90910dd)
4. ✅ Push to GitHub (all commits pushed successfully)
5. ✅ Deploy backend service (deployed 3 times with different configs)
6. ✅ Verify API health endpoint (confirmed: 502 error, build not running)

**STATUS:** Automated fixes exhausted. Requires manual Railway Dashboard configuration.

### Post-Deployment Verification (Any Agent)
1. Test: `curl -i https://api.imaginethisprinted.com/api/health`
2. Expected: JSON response `{"ok": true, ...}`
3. Check: Content-Type should be `application/json`
4. Update this file with results

### Before Production Launch (Agent: Security/DevOps)
1. Regenerate all API keys exposed in git history
2. Update environment variables in Railway
3. Test authentication flows end-to-end
4. Review `PRODUCTION_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`
5. Configure monitoring/alerting
