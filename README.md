## Authentication Setup & Troubleshooting

### Supabase Dashboard Configuration

**CRITICAL**: For OAuth authentication to work across all domains (production, Railway, localhost), you MUST configure your Supabase project correctly.

See the detailed checklist in: [`SUPABASE_AUTH_CHECKLIST.md`](./SUPABASE_AUTH_CHECKLIST.md)

**Quick Setup Steps:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**

2. **Set Site URL:**
   ```
   https://imaginethisprinted.com
   ```

3. **Add ALL Redirect URLs** (comma-separated or one per line):
   ```
   https://imaginethisprinted.com/auth/callback
   https://imaginethisprinted.com/auth/reset-password
   https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/auth/callback
   https://your-railway-domain.up.railway.app/auth/reset-password
   http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
   http://localhost:5173/auth/reset-password
   ```

4. **Enable Google OAuth** (if using):
   - Go to **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Google**
   - Enable and add your Google OAuth credentials
   - Ensure Google Cloud Console has the correct redirect URI:
     ```
     https://czzyrmizvjqlifcivrhn.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
     ```

5. **Enable PKCE Flow** (REQUIRED):
   - Go to **Authentication** → **Settings**
   - Ensure Auth Flow Type is **PKCE** (Code Flow)
   - **Do NOT use Implicit Flow** - it causes race conditions and callback hangs

### How Authentication Works (PKCE Flow)

**Important:** As of 2025-10-31, the auth callback has been rewritten to use **PKCE flow only** to eliminate race conditions. See [AUTH_CALLBACK_FIX_GUIDE.md](./AUTH_CALLBACK_FIX_GUIDE.md) for details.

1. **OAuth Sign-In Flow (PKCE):**
   - User clicks "Sign in with Google"
   - System saves current path to localStorage (`auth_return_to`)
   - Redirects to Google OAuth with `redirectTo` callback URL
   - Google redirects back to `/auth/callback?code=...` (PKCE code, NOT tokens)

2. **Callback Handler** ([src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx](src/pages/AuthCallback.tsx)):
   - Detects `code` parameter in query string
   - Calls `exchangeCodeForSession(fullUrl)` to exchange code for session
   - Verifies session exists with `getSession()`
   - Checks localStorage persistence (`itp-auth-v1` key)
   - Cleans URL and redirects to intended page
   - **Total time: <2 seconds** (no race conditions, no timeouts)

3. **Session Management** ([src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.tsx](src/context/SupabaseAuthContext.tsx)):
   - Initializes on app load with `getSession()`
   - Listens for auth state changes via `onAuthStateChange`
   - Maps Supabase user to app user profile (from `user_profiles` table)
   - Auto-refreshes tokens before expiration

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch" Error
**Cause:** The domain you're on isn't in Supabase's allowed redirect URLs
**Solution:** Add the exact URL to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration** → **Redirect URLs**

#### Issue: Session Doesn't Persist After Login
**Cause:** localStorage not being set or wrong storageKey
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for `[callback]` and `[AuthContext]` logs
- Verify `itp-auth-v1` key exists in localStorage
- Clear localStorage and try again
- Ensure `persistSession: true` in Supabase client config

#### Issue: "No session after handling URL"
**Cause:** Auth exchange failed or session not persisted
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for detailed error logs
- Verify Supabase environment variables are correct
- Ensure PKCE is enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Try clearing browser cache and localStorage

#### Issue: Callback Stuck on "Completing sign in..." (FIXED 2025-10-31)
**Cause:** Race condition between PKCE and implicit flows, or `setSession()` hanging
**Solution:** This issue has been fixed in the latest version. If you still experience it:
- Clear browser cache and localStorage completely
- Test in incognito mode to rule out extension interference
- Check console for `⚠️ IMPLICIT TOKENS DETECTED` warning
- If you see that warning, your Supabase Auth is NOT using PKCE - go to Dashboard → Authentication → Settings and enable PKCE
- See [AUTH_CALLBACK_FIX_GUIDE.md](./AUTH_CALLBACK_FIX_GUIDE.md) for detailed diagnosis

#### Issue: User Profile Not Loading
**Cause:** `user_profiles` table query failed
**Solution:**
- Check if user profile exists in Supabase database
- Verify RLS policies allow reading user profiles
- Check browser console for `[AuthContext]` error logs

#### Issue: OAuth Works on One Domain but Not Another
**Cause:** Missing domain in Supabase redirect URLs
**Solution:**
- Add ALL domains to Supabase redirect URLs
- Include both production domain AND Railway domain
- Don't forget `/auth/callback` path for each domain

### Debugging Authentication

The app has comprehensive logging. Open browser console and filter by:
- `[supabase]` - Supabase client initialization
- `[callback]` - OAuth callback handler
- `[AuthContext]` - Auth context and session management

**Typical successful login flow:**
```
[supabase] 🔧 Initializing Supabase client...
[supabase] ✅ Supabase client initialized
[AuthContext] 🚀 Initializing auth context...
[AuthContext] 📦 Initial session check: { hasSession: false }
[callback] 1️⃣ Full URL: https://...?code=...
[callback] 2️⃣ Found code in query → exchangeCodeForSession (PKCE flow)
[callback] 3️⃣ PKCE SUCCESS → session: true
[callback] 4️⃣ Final session check: true
[callback] 5️⃣ Storage verification: itp-auth-v1
[callback] 7️⃣ User verification: true
[callback] 8️⃣ Navigating to: /
[AuthContext] 🔄 Auth state changed: SIGNED_IN
[AuthContext] ✅ User profile loaded: username
```

### Testing Authentication

1. **Clear localStorage:** Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage → Clear All
2. **Test OAuth:** Click "Sign in with Google" and verify flow
3. **Check Console:** Look for any `❌` error logs
4. **Verify Persistence:** Refresh page, check if user stays logged in
5. **Test on All Domains:** Verify auth works on localhost, Railway, and production

### Railway Deployment Notes

Railway has two services for this project:
- **imagine-this-printed** (frontend) - needs VITE_* variables
- **backend** - needs SUPABASE_* and other backend variables

To check/update Railway variables:
```bash
# List services
railway service

# Check current variables (select frontend service)
railway variables

# Add a variable
railway variables set VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
```

Make sure the frontend service has all VITE_ prefixed variables!

## Email & API Post-Rotation Checklist

### Brevo API Key Rotation

When rotating the Brevo API key (for email services):

1. **Generate new API key** in Brevo Dashboard:
   - Go to https://app.brevo.com/
   - Navigate to Settings → API Keys
   - Create new API key
   - Copy the full key (starts with `xkeysib-`)

2. **Update Railway backend service**:
   ```bash
   railway service  # Select "backend"
   railway variables set BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-your-new-key-here
   ```

3. **Verify other email variables** (should already be set):
   ```bash
   railway variables  # Check these exist:
   # BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=wecare@imaginethisprinted.com
   # BREVO_SENDER_NAME=Imagine This Printed
   ```

4. **Redeploy backend**:
   ```bash
   railway up --service backend
   ```

5. **Test email service**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.imaginethisprinted.com/api/health/email
   # Should return: { "ok": true, "messageId": "...", "apiKeyTail": "...BMF1" }
   ```

6. **Check backend logs** for environment confirmation:
   ```bash
   railway logs --service backend
   # Look for: [env:api] { BREVO_API_KEY_tail: '...BMF1', ... }
   ```

### Supabase SMTP Settings

Configure Supabase to send emails via Brevo:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → **Project Settings** → **Auth**

2. **Scroll to "SMTP Settings"** and configure:
   ```
   Host: smtp-relay.brevo.com
   Port: 587
   Username: (your Brevo login email)
   Password: (your Brevo SMTP password - NOT API key!)
   Sender email: wecare@imaginethisprinted.com
   Sender name: Imagine This Printed
   ```

3. **Enable SMTP** and test by sending a password reset email

### Health Endpoints

The backend provides health check endpoints for monitoring:

**General Health:**
```bash
curl https://api.imaginethisprinted.com/api/health
# Returns: { "ok": true }
```

**Email Service Health:**
```bash
curl https://api.imaginethisprinted.com/api/health/email
# Sends test email and returns:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "messageId": "...",
#   "sender": "wecare@imaginethisprinted.com",
#   "apiKeyTail": "...BMF1"
# }
```

**Auth Configuration:**
```bash
curl https://api.imaginethisprinted.com/api/health/auth
# Returns:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "supabaseUrl": "https://czzyrmizvjqlifcivrhn.supabase.co",
#   "frontendUrl": "https://imaginethisprinted.com",
#   "anonKeyTail": "...VGs",
#   "callbackUrl": "https://imaginethisprinted.com/auth/callback"
# }
```

**Database Health:**
```bash
curl https://api.imaginethisprinted.com/api/health/database
# Returns: { "status": "connected", "message": "Database connected (N users)" }
```

### Environment Logging

Both frontend and backend log environment variables on startup (with secrets masked):

**Frontend Console (browser DevTools):**
```
[env:frontend] {
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL: "https://czzyrmizvjqlifcivrhn.supabase.co",
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_tail: "...x81uOOyA",
  VITE_SITE_URL: "https://imaginethisprinted.com",
  VITE_API_BASE: "https://api.imaginethisprinted.com"
}
```

**Backend Logs (Railway):**
```
[env:api] {
  NODE_ENV: "production",
  BREVO_API_KEY_tail: "...BMF1",
  BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL: "wecare@imaginethisprinted.com",
  SUPABASE_URL: "https://czzyrmizvjqlifcivrhn.supabase.co",
  FRONTEND_URL: "https://imaginethisprinted.com"
}
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying changes:

1. **Check frontend logs** (browser console):
   - Visit https://imaginethisprinted.com
   - Look for `[env:frontend]` log
   - Verify all VITE_ variables are present

2. **Check backend logs** (Railway):
   ```bash
   railway logs --service backend --tail 50
   ```
   - Look for `[env:api]` log
   - Verify BREVO_API_KEY_tail matches last 4 chars of your key

3. **Test auth flow**:
   - Sign in with email/password or Google OAuth
   - Check console for `[callback] PKCE SUCCESS → session: true`
   - Verify redirect to `/` and session persistence

4. **Test email**:
   - Trigger a password reset or signup
   - Check email delivery to your inbox
   - Or use `/api/health/email` endpoint
