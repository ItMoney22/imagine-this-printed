“Nano Banana” name must be removed everywhere including:

Buttons

Toast messages

API responses

Logs

Comments

Generated layer metadata

Replacement Name:

ITP Enhance Engine
(or confirm another name you want)

5. Canvas Interaction Issues
5.1 Resize by Dragging Should Always Work

You noted this sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t.

Fix:

Rebuild Konva transformer logic

Ensure transformer is added when layer is selected

Fix z-index issues

Add large hit area for mobile usability

5.2 Duplicate Works Correctly (Keep as-is)
5.3 Delete Works Correctly (Keep as-is)
6. Export Options Need to Be Removed / Replaced
6.1 Export as PNG (REMOVE)
Reason:

Users should not be able to export anything directly.

Expected replacement:

Replace with “Add to Cart”

Export to production is handled by backend only

6.2 Export as PDF (REMOVE)
Replacement:

“Add to Cart” button triggers:

Save sheet JSON

Save preview thumbnail

Attach sheet to order metadata

Production backend generates print file

Staff reviews & prints

7. Resolution & Quality Checking
7.1 Image DPI Detection Must Be Implemented
Expected behavior:

On image upload, check pixel width × height

Assign print DPI based on sheet scaling

Warn if:

Below 150 DPI (YELLOW)

Below 100 DPI (RED danger)

Missing:

No warning system exists

No resolution evaluation

No visual indicators

Fix:

Add DPI analyzer in frontend

Add warnings in sidebar

Prevent checkout if critical DPI issues exist

8. Features That Currently Do Nothing (Must Fix)
Feature	Should Do	Currently Does
Include Cut Lines	Add stroke around shape	Nothing
Mirror for Sublimation	Flip horizontally	Nothing

Save the sheet configuration JSON

Save a 150–300 DPI preview image

Push to order with proper SKU

Production backend handles the real export

10. Images & Screenshots Section (To Be Added by You)

Paste your screenshots under this section once the document is in Drive.

After we finish adding all screenshots and verifying every bug, I will generate a single super-prompt for MetaDev that includes:

All broken features

Step-by-step fixes
